# Jobcoin Mixer

### Intention
A small program that looks to mimic some of the basic flow of a coin mixer.

### Running the program

This program is written in ruby. In order to run it, please follow these instructions:

- clone/download/fork the repo
- if you do not have the `bundler` gem installed (you can check by running `gem list`) run:
`gem install bundler`
- then run `bundle install`. This will install all the dependencies for the project
- in order to start the program, execute the following in the root of this project:
`ruby index.rb`
